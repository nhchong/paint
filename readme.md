This is a simple paint application built by Nicholas Chong for CS349.

For my additional features I created the personalized color palette. When you right-click on one of the colors, the color chooser appears and you can choose a color. It will replace the old color with the new. If a user selects a shape that was filled with this color, the color pallette will not have any color selected.

Note that the only time i coudl think of diasbling features was when the disabling of the line thickness buttons when the tool selected isn't the rectangle, line, or circle.
